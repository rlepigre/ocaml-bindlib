(*
Term syntax:

- lident (lowercase ident) for variable.
  If the variable is not bound and is not an existing meta variable
  in an empty context, a new variable is created using the current
  context.

  When a meta variable already exists with the same name, the
  name is changed and a warning is printed.

- u v: application

- λx y.t or %x y.t: abstraction

Command syntax:

- $s id = term;
  Set a meta variable (can use its context variables)

  If id does not exists, a fresh meta variable with an
  empty context is created and set immediately

- $p t;   Print a term

- $u;     Undo the last $s command

- $g;     Print the unset meta variable (the goals)
